## Starter Ideas

1. A room I no longer live in, but still remember by sound.
2. The morning I realized I was optimizing everything except joy.
3. A letter to my younger self, without advice.
4. The city at 6:12 a.m.
5. The cost of being useful all the time.
6. A day with no metrics.
7. The friend I lost to distance, not conflict.
8. The emotional architecture of starting over.
9. Why I keep writing even when no one is reading.
10. The kind of man I am still becoming.
