I write as a literary digital writer of the digital era.

The timeline is fast. Language is flattened. Attention is fragmented. I write against that collapse.

Not with nostalgia. With precision.

## What I Refuse

- Writing that performs depth instead of earning it.
- Voice that sounds efficient but not alive.
- Sentences built for engagement and not memory.

## What I Commit To

- Scene before abstraction.
- Specificity before slogan.
- Human truth before algorithmic taste.

## Why This Exists

Because the digital era does not only need more content. It needs writing that can still be felt.

If a line can be scrolled past and forgotten instantly, it is not finished. If a line can be revisited and still hold weight, it belongs here.
