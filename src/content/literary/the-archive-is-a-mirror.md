An archive is not neutral.

It shows what you repeated, what you avoided, and what you were not ready to name.

## What It Reveals

The pattern of returns.

Which scenes keep resurfacing when no one is watching.

## Why Keep One

Because memory edits itself.

An archive gives you a hard edge against revisionist nostalgia.
