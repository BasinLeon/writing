I used to think speed proved clarity.

Then I reread old drafts and realized velocity had hidden the line that mattered.

Write slower than the feed.

Build one sentence that can hold weight without context.

## The Test

If a paragraph only works in the moment, it is content.
If it still works next month, it begins to become literature.
