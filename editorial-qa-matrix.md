This is the mandatory quality gate for every published essay.

## 1) Scene Before Abstraction

- Every abstract idea must be grounded in at least one concrete scene.
- If a paragraph has only concepts, rewrite it with place, action, and sensory detail.

## 2) Human Voice Over Algorithmic Taste

- Remove trend hooks, false urgency, and filler transitions.
- Replace generic claims with precise language and lived observation.

## 3) Built For Rereading

- Sentence rhythm must vary enough to control reading speed.
- Keep at least one line per section that can stand alone and stay memorable.
- If a line is instantly forgettable, revise or cut it.
